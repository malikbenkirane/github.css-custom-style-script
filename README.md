# About:

Using [_firefox addon_ to inject desired CSS (Custom Syle Script ->)][1] the
css provided here is a workaround to the fix width property in github official
CSS. Just few  css lines to allow reading github.com in a browser aside one
terminal (or two terminals if the screen is big). That's all, enjoy.

This is free and thus if you find it useful feed it!
